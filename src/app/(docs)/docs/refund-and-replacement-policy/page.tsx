                <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                    Effective Date: 24/07/2025 – Present
                    <br />
                    Business Name: Raydient Studio (hereinafter referred to as “Raydient Studio,” “we,” “us,” or “our”)
                    <br />
                    Website: <a href="https://raydientstudio.com" className="text-blue-600 underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raydientstudio.com</a>

                {/* 1. Revision Policy */}
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">1. Revision Policy</h3>
                <p><strong>1.1 Standard Revisions:</strong> All projects include a defined number of revisions, as specified in the official proposal or service agreement. Revisions are intended to refine the original deliverable within the agreed scope, not to initiate entirely new concepts or change approved directions.</p>
                <p><strong>1.2 Additional Revisions:</strong> If you require revisions beyond the included number, additional charges may apply, communicated transparently before proceeding.</p>

                {/* 2. Replacement Policy */}
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">2. Replacement Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    As Raydient Studio is a service-based agency and does not sell digital products as stand-alone purchases, the concept of “replacement” does not typically apply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the rare event of technical errors or deliverable corruption, we will correct or re-deliver the affected files promptly at no additional cost within the agreed project timeline.
                </p>

                {/* 3. Refund Policy */}
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">3. Refund Policy</h3>
                <p><strong>3.1 General Principle:</strong> Due to the custom, creative, and service-oriented nature of our work, all payments are non-refundable. This ensures fairness for the time, expertise, and resources allocated to your project.</p>

                <p><strong>3.2 Exceptional Refund Eligibility:</strong> Refunds will only be considered under exceptional circumstances, such as:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
                    <li>Non-delivery of services where no work has commenced due to internal scheduling failure.</li>
                    <li>Duplicate payment due to a technical error on our payment gateway.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>3.3 Refund Conditions:</strong></p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
                    <li>Requests must be submitted within 7 days of payment.</li>
                    <li>Refunds will be processed via the original payment method within 7–10 business days.</li>
                    <li>Refunds will not be granted once project work has commenced or resources have been allocated.</li>
                </ul>

                {/* 4. No Return Policy */}
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">4. No Return Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    As a service-based agency, returns are not applicable since services such as design drafts, consultations, and development code are non-returnable and non-reversible once delivered.
                </p>

                {/* 5. Process for Refund Requests */}
                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">5. Process for Refund Requests</h3>
